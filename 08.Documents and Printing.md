What's New for Printing
Windows 8 supports printing for Windows Store apps using JavaScript and HTML and printing for Windows Store apps using C#/VB/C++ and XAML.
Windows 8 also includes a new COM-based API that provides full support for Open XPS and access to portions of the new printer drivers that Windows 8 supports. For more information about the new API, see Print Document Package API.
The Windows Print Driver Inbox Program makes sure that Windows 8 includes support for a high percentage of the popular printers.
XPS Documents
Information about the XPS Document API an XPS Digital Signatures.
XPS Document API
The XPS Document API is a native Windows API that supports the XPS OM. The XPS Document API was introduced in Windows 7 and can be used in user-mode programs and XPSDrv printer drivers.

Print Schema
The Print Schema and related technologies describe a printer's features and specify the printing preferences of a document to printers and viewing applications. The Print Schema Specification is a downloadable document that contains information about the Print Schema and how to use it in documents and printing. The online information that is found in this section is provided for your information only and might not accurately reflect the current version of the Print Schema Specification.
Refer to the Print Schema Specification for the most current design information.
