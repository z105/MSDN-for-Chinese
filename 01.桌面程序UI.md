Getting Started Developing User Interfaces for Windows Applications | Provides general guidance to developers who are designing, implementing, and testing the user interface of a Windows application.(为正在设计，实现和测试Windows程序界面的开发者提供一般性的指导)
Windows User Experience Interaction Guidelines | The "UX Guide" for short, these are the official Windows User Experience Interaction Guidelines for Windows 7 and Windows Vista(简称"UX Guide.这些是Windows 7和Windows Vista官方的用户体验交互指南").
Internationalization for Windows Applications | Describes the technologies that enable you to support the many cultures and written languages of the international marketplace in your Windows-based applications.（使你的应用程序支持多种文化和国际化语言）
Accessibility | Describes accessibility features that make it easier for persons with disabilities to use computers.（描述使残疾人更容易使用计算机的可访问性特性。）
User Interaction | Describes features that enable the user to interact with an application, through devices such as the keyboard, mouse, and touch screens.（使用户能够通过键盘、鼠标和触摸屏等设备与应用程序交互的功能。）
Windows and Messages | Describes the elements of an application with a Windows-based graphical user interface.(用基于windows的图形用户界面描述应用程序的元素。)
Desktop Window Manager | Desktop Window Manager (DWM) enables visual effects on the desktop as well as various features such as glass window frames, 3-D window transition animations, Windows Flip and Windows Flip3D, and high resolution support.(桌面窗口管理器(DWM)支持桌面视觉效果，以及各种功能，如玻璃窗框、3d窗口转换动画、Windows Flip和Windows Flip3D，以及高分辨率支持。)
Dialog Boxes | A dialog box is a temporary window an application creates to retrieve user input. An application typically uses dialog boxes to prompt the user for additional information for menu items. A dialog box usually contains one or more controls (child windows) with which the user enters text, chooses options, or directs the action.(对话框是应用程序创建用来检索用户输入的临时窗口。应用程序通常使用对话框提示用户添加菜单项的附加信息。对话框通常包含一个或多个控件(子窗口)，用户输入文本，选择选项，或指导操作。)
Menus and Other Resources | A resource is binary data that you can add to the executable file of a Windows-based application. A resource can be either standard or defined. The data in a standard resource describes an icon, cursor, menu, dialog box, bitmap, enhanced metafile, font, accelerator table, message-table entry, string-table entry, or version information. An application-defined resource, also called a custom resource, contains any data required by a specific application.(资源是一个二进制文件，你可以将其包含在可执行文件中。资源可以是标准的或定义的。数据在标准的资源中描述为图标，鼠标，菜单，对话框，位图，增强型图元文件，字体，快捷键表，message-table entry，字符串条目，包含特定程序所需的所有数据)
Data Exchange | Describes basic methods of exchanging data, such as the clipboard and Dynamic Data Exchange.（讲述数据交换的方法，例如剪切板和动态数据交换）
High DPI | Writing a DPI-aware application is the key to making a UI look consistently good across a wide variety of high-DPI display settings. An application that is not DPI-aware but is running on a high-DPI display setting can suffer from many visual artifacts, including incorrect scaling of UI elements, clipped text, and blurry images. By adding support in your application for DPI awareness, you guarantee that the presentation of your application's UI is more predictable, making it more visually appealing to users.（）
Windows Animation Manager | The Windows Animation Manager (Windows Animation) enables rich animation of user interface elements. It is designed to simplify the process of adding animation to an application's user interface and to enable developers to implement animations that are smooth, natural, and interactive.
Windows Controls | A control is a child window that an application uses in conjunction with another window to enable user interaction. Controls provide the user a way to view and edit text, choose options, choose commands, initiate actions, and view status.
Windows Ribbon Framework | The Windows Ribbon framework is a rich command presentation system that provides a modern alternative to the layered menus, toolbars, and task panes of traditional Windows applications. The Ribbon framework is composed of a ribbon command bar that exposes the major features of an application through a series of tabs at the top of an application window, and a context menu system.
Tiles, badges, and notifications for Classic desktop applications | Describes how to respond to toast notifications that appear in the action center. These toasts can be used to simply activate your application, or they can be used to gather information from the user and alter the launch protocol based on that information.
Title Callable UI | Do not use. This API set is only supported for Xbox developers.
